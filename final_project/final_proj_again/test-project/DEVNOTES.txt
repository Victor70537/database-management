Files & Directories:

* Target contains compiler stuff -- leave this alone
* Src contains our actual code:
    * main -> java -> contains Java (backend) stuff
    * main -> resources -> contains website (frontend) stuff

* main->java->edu->uga->cs4370-> contains java files: WebController, App, Books, Ratings, Users, Librarians, Signings, Readings, Fines, Copies, Reservations, and Requests (all .java files)

* main->resources->static-> contains folders for css, js, and images; css contains style.css, js contains script.js, and images are just for the website.
