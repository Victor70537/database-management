In our LibAlpha project, we've implemented secure password storage using BCrypt, which is a robust password hashing function. When users create an account, their passwords are hashed using BCrypt before being stored in the database. This means we never store actual passwords, just their hashed versions. For login, the entered password is hashed and compared with the stored hash. This approach makes sure that even if our database is compromised, the actual passwords remain secure and inaccessible, thanks to the one-way nature of BCrypt hashing.
